/**
 * Framework-agnostic wallet core.
 *
 * Every piece of wallet behaviour — passkey registration, contract deployment,
 * Soroban authorization signing, payments, multi-signer and guardian recovery —
 * lives here as a plain class with no framework imports. The React hook
 * (`useInvisibleWallet`) and the Vue composable (`invisible-wallet-sdk/vue`)
 * are thin reactive wrappers over this one implementation, so the two adapters
 * stay in lockstep by construction rather than by discipline.
 *
 * State changes are published through {@link InvisibleWalletCore.subscribe},
 * which is shaped for React's `useSyncExternalStore` and just as usable from a
 * Vue `ref` or any other observer.
